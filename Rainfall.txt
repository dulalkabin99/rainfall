4. How much water runs off the roof
How much water runs off a roof in a rain storm?

To calculate the runoff from any given rainfall: 
Take the dimensions of the footprint of the roof and convert them to inches. 
(So, a 50' x 20' roof is 600" x 240"). Multiply the roof dimensions by the number of inches of rainfall. 
In this example, 600" x 240" x 1" = 144,000 cubic inches of water.
Divide that result by 231 to get the number of gallons (because 1 gallon = 231 cubic inches). (144,000/231 = 623.38).


Algorihms
---------------------------------------------------------------
inputs
	lenth of the roof footprint
	width of the roof footprint
	number of inches of rainfall
	
Processing
	change the length of the roof to inches
	change the width of the roof to inches
	Multiply the length of roof by 12 to convert into inches
	Multiply the width of roof by 12 to convert into inches
	multiply length length and rainfall
	divide it by 231
Outputs
	display result in inches

Pseudocode
	set length to getLenth from user
	set width to getwidth from user
	set inchRain to get InchRain from user

	set length to length *12
	set width to width * 12

	set Rainfall to ((lenth * width) (inchRain))/231
	print rainfall.
